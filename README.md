# Deep-Neural-Network-with-Keras-for-MNIST-handwritten-classification-and-recognition
We are going to employ the keras based python deep learning framework that readily offers complex mathematical layers that compute and form weights that are resultant of the data the model is viewing and learning from and then predict on new dataset.
